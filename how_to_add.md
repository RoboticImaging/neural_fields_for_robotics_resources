# Adding Resources
This repo is maintained by the [Robotic Imaging Research Group](https://roboticimaging.org) at the [University of Sydney](https://sydney.edu.au). We are embedded within the [Australian Centre for Field Robotics](https://www.sydney.edu.au/engineering/our-research/robotics-and-intelligent-systems/australian-centre-for-field-robotics.html) and [Sydney Institute for Robotics and Intelligent Systems](https://www.sydney.edu.au/engineering/our-research/robotics-and-intelligent-systems/sydney-institute-for-robotics-and-intelligent-systems.html).

To assist us with keeping this repo up-to-date, please feel free to suggest new resources by creating a pull request. For ease of moderating, please abide by the following:
- Use IEEE formatting of references [as per this document](https://ieeeauthorcenter.ieee.org/wp-content/uploads/IEEE-Reference-Guide.pdf).
- If there are additional links (paper, project pages, posters, videos, code etc.), please add the links below the citation by hyperlinking using one of those key words.
- More recent papers should be located up the top of each section (try to follow dates).
- If you see arXiv links where papers have since been published, please update them.
- If new categories emerge, or papers may be better positioned - your suggestions are welcomed to clean up the document.

Thank you in advance for your submissions in tracking the exciting world of NeRFs/neural scenes!
