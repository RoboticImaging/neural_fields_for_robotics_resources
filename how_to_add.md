# Adding Resources
This repo is maintained by the [Robotic Imaging Research Group](https://roboticimaging.org) at the [University of Sydney](https://sydney.edu.au). We are embedded within the [Australian Centre for Field Robotics](https://www.sydney.edu.au/engineering/our-research/robotics-and-intelligent-systems/australian-centre-for-field-robotics.html) and [Sydney Institute for Robotics and Intelligent Systems](https://www.sydney.edu.au/engineering/our-research/robotics-and-intelligent-systems/sydney-institute-for-robotics-and-intelligent-systems.html).

To assist us with keeping this repo up-to-date, please feel free to suggest new resources by creating a pull request and adding your submission into one of the relevant `src/*.bib` files. 
- If there are additional links (paper, project pages, posters, videos, code etc.), please add the links below the citation by adding the links in the notes section of the bibtex.
- More recent papers should be located up the top of each section (try to follow dates).
- If you see arXiv links where papers have since been published, please update them.
- If new categories emerge, or papers may be better positioned - your suggestions are welcomed to clean up the document. Please use the previous sections as templates to add in new areas, or create an issue where we can help you out!

Thank you in advance for your submissions in tracking the exciting world of NeRFs/neural scenes!
