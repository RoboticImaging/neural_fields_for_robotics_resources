# Neural Fields for Robotics Resources
A repo collating papers and other material related to neural radiance fields (NeRFs), neural scene representations and associated works with a focus towards applications in robotics.

This repo is maintained by the [Robotic Imaging Research Group](https://roboticimaging.org) at the [University of Sydney](https://sydney.edu.au). We are embedded within the [Australian Centre for Field Robotics](https://www.sydney.edu.au/engineering/our-research/robotics-and-intelligent-systems/australian-centre-for-field-robotics.html) and [Sydney Institute for Robotics and Intelligent Systems](https://www.sydney.edu.au/engineering/our-research/robotics-and-intelligent-systems/sydney-institute-for-robotics-and-intelligent-systems.html).

To contribute, please see the `how_to_add.md` file.
